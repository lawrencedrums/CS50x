# CS50x

https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/

Documenting my progress through the CS50x course offered by Harvard University on EdX starting from May 2020.
## Introduction
>Demanding, but definitely doable. Social, but educational. 

I first enrolled back in 2018 but only managed to finish the week 2 problem set. After that I lost motivation and interest, thinking C and the following problem sets are too difficult for me. Thanks to all the wonderful teaching staffs of CS50x, through their precise and clear explainations, and with a healthy dose of humor and eastereggs, I rediscovered my curiousity for computer science and the joy of programming. CS50x is definintly life-changing and eye-opening experience for me.

In this repository I will upload every problem set I completed. While these programs are not even close to perfection, I think this is a great chance to start building my portfolio on Github and get comfortable with how this beautiful site works. 

Please feel free to ask me any questions on any of my programs. If you're currently enrolled in CS50x please don't just blindly copy and paste my work. Look at the codes, understand how they work, try them out in your sandbox. Once you're confident, close this tab and write your own versions, that's when you know you've truely learnt :D I wish you all good luck!
