# CS50x

Documenting my progress through the CS50x course offered by Harvard University on EdX. 

I enrolled back in 2018 but only managed to finish the week 2 problem set. After that I lost motivation and interest, thinking C and the next problem set are too difficult. During the COVID-19 epidemic I rediscovered the course and the joy of programming. Together with my desire to immigrate out of Hong Kong, I decided to pursuit a career of a software engineer at the age of 26 (as of 31 May, 2020). My first goal is to finish this course, and then move my focus towards Java or Python.

In this repository I will upload every completed problem sets from the course. While these programs are not close to perfection or even good, I reckon this is a great chance to start building my portfolio on Github and get comfortable with how this wonderful site works.
